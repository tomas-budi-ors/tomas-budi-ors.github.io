abstract: 'Using administrative data on Spanish firms, I show that firm growth over the life-cycle is higher in larger cities, while firm entry and exit rates are invariant to city-size. Based on these facts, I build a firm-dynamics model in which firms in big cities may grow larger due to the effects of agglomeration forces on their productivity but also due to their fundamental efficiency. I use the model to decompose firm productivity differences across cities into the effects of agglomeration economies and the sorting of ex-ante more efficient firms. I find that the most efficient firms, motivated by a strong complementarity between their raw efficiency and city-size, sort into large cities, explaining most of the differences in firm productivity across the city-size distribution.'}
