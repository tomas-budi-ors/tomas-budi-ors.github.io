abstract: 'Using administrative data on Spanish firms, I show that firms are more productive and grow more over their life-cycle in larger cities.  I use this information to discipline a model of firm dynamics in which firms in big cities may grow larger due to (i) the effects of agglomeration forces on their productivity, or (ii) the evolution of their fundamental efficiency. I use the model to decompose the productivity differences across cities into the strength of agglomeration economies and the sorting of ex-ante more efficient firms, which has implications for place-based policies.'}
