abstract: 'Using administrative data on Spanish firms, I show that firm growth over the life-cycle is faster in larger cities, while entry and exit rates are invariant to city size. I use these facts to discipline a model where ex-ante heterogenous firms choose location based on the expected evolution of their productivity, which also depends on city size due to agglomeration externalities. I use the model to revisit the question of why firms are more productive in larger cities.'}
