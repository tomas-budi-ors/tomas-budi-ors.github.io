    abstract: 'Abstract: Structural change and rural to urban migration are often seen as a single reallocation process. However, using panel data on Indonesian workers spanning two decades, I present evidence that challenges this standard view. First, I document that workers switch from agriculture to non-agriculture within rural areas, and that most rural-urban migrants are not farmers. Second, I show that aggregate reallocation out of agriculture is primarily driven by the entry of younger cohorts into the labor market, rather than by workers who leave agriculture. Third, I provide evidence that rural-urban migration has intergenerational effects, as the offspring of migrants are less likely to work in agriculture, attain higher levels of education, and earn more. To uncover the forces and frictions giving rise to these patterns of employment reallocation and their aggregate implications, I build an overlapping generations model with two sectors and two locations. In the model, switching sector or location is costly, and access to education differs by location. First, different from the standard view, I find that rural-urban migration has little impact on structural change. The rural non-agricultural sector absorbs most of the workers that leave agriculture in rural areas, which is nonetheless detrimental for aggregate growth. Next, I uncover that sectoral switching costs, rather than differences in education, are the main driver of the cohort-level differences in sectoral employment shares. Finally, I show that intergenerational incentives for rural-urban migration are an important driver of urbanization and hence can have a large impact on economic growth.'}

   abstract: 'We show how internal migrations are a key determinant of the heterogeneous industrialization paths experienced by leading and laggard regions within a country.
    Focusing on Spain (1940-2000), we find that internal migrations, driven by declining migration costs and diverging sectoral productivities across regions, fully explain the lack of industrialization of its laggard areas, and accelerated growth and structural change at the aggregate level.'}
#We show how internal migrations are a key determinant of the cross-country heterogeneity in the extent to which industrialization is a local phenomenon or, instead, concentrates in a few regions of the country. Focusing on Spain,
