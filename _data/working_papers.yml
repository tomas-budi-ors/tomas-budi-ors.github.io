    abstract: 'Using panel data from Indonesia, I show that most workers switch from agriculture to non-agriculture within rural areas, rather than through migration to urban areas. Armed with a model in which workers choose both their location and their sector of work, I find that frictions to leave agriculture, rather than rural areas, are the main barrier to structural transformation.'}

   abstract: 'We show how internal migrations are a key determinant of the heterogeneous industrialization paths experienced by leading and laggard regions within a country.
    Focusing on Spain (1940-2000), we find that internal migrations, driven by declining migration costs, fully explain the lack of industrialization of its laggard areas, and accelerated growth at the aggregate level.'}
#We show how internal migrations are a key determinant of the cross-country heterogeneity in the extent to which industrialization is a local phenomenon or, instead, concentrates in a few regions of the country. Focusing on Spain,
